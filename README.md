Not much here. Didn't even use git *lmao*. Add each of those directories into .config or add the files inside of them in their respective paths (depending on what you use). Terminal colors are inside /xfce4/terminal/terminalrc.

Example path for the terminalrc file:-
        
        ~/.config/xfce4/terminal/terminalrc
